## Notes on Studying

* Pick an exam date and really shoot for it. You don't need to buy the voucher until you get closer, but set a concrete goal and plan to stick to it.
* Focus on finding sample questions.
* Maintain consistent study habits. Do at least a little bit every day or nearly every day.
